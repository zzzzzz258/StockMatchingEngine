"Client" is a sub-project in our top-level project for the Exchange Matching Server. Initially the "main" method in the Client class was used as the entrypoint of the Client application to test serial implementation. After adding the multi-threading in the server application, the "main" method in the Multi-Client class was used to spawn multiple threads to send requests to the server to test the server's scalability.
